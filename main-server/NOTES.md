# Notes and Journal

1. Got all files copied according to structure. Have a Claude conversation going on this.
2. Want to get basic Go program running.
3. Installed postgresql instance with `brew`, need to configure.
4. ~~Trying to run Localstack on Unraid to provide mock S3 storage. Might want to consider this for a Postgres instance too~~.

Goals: 
    * Get a basic version running.
    * Change authentication to AWS Cognito (or localstack equiv)
    * Work on layouts
    * Want to mock out some `match` service so that I can mock send onboardings
    * Make tests for the whole bloody mess
